There is no sucessful project without testing.
So we should love testing.
Principle 1: Testing shows presence of defects ,but cannot prove that there are no defects.

We always should start testing at the begining of software development lift cycle.
Because all things will be wrong if we get the wrong requirement at first.
Principle 2:Early Testing

We should accept the reality that nothing is perfect.
And the resources are always limited.
So we need do the most important things first.
