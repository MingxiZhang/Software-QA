There is no sucessful project without testing.
So we should love testing.
Principle 1: Testing shows presence of defects ,but cannot prove that there are no defects.

We always should start testing at the begining of software development lift cycle.
Because all things will be wrong if we get the wrong requirement at first.
Principle 2:Early Testing

We should accept the reality that nothing is perfect.
And the resources are always limited.
So we need to use risks and priorities to focus testing efforts.
Principle 3: Exhaustive testing is impossible.

Different kinds of softwares are designed for different purposes.
Testing is done differently in different contexts.
Principle 4: Testing is context dependent.

Only God is omnipotent. Everyting has its limit.
The same set of test case will no longer find any new bugs.
