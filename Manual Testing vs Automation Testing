Manual Testing does not require knowledge of any testing tool.
100% Automation is not possible.This makes Manual Testing imperative.
The goal of Manual Testing is to ensure that the application is error free and it is working
in conformance to the specified functional requirements.
Software Testing Types:
1.Acceptance Testing
2.Black Box
3.White Box
4.Unit Testing 
5.System Testing
6.Integration Testing

Goal of Automation is to reduce number of test cases to be run manually and not eliminate
manual testing all together.
Automated Testing saves time and manpower,increases test coverage and speed of test execution.

Whick Test Cases to Automate?
1.High Risk- Business Critical test cases
2.Test cases that are executed repeatedly
3.Test Cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually
4.Test Cases which are time consuming

The following category of test cases are not suitable for automation:
1.Test Cases that are newly designed and not executed manually at least once
2.Test Cases for which the requirements are changing frequently
3.Test Cases which are executed on ad-hoc basis

Following are the most popular test tools:
QTP:HP's Quick Test Profession(now known as HP Functional Test) is the market leader in Functional Testing Tool.
QTP does not support Infromatica.
QTP can be used in conjunction with Quality Center which is a comprehensive Test Management Tool know is light
tool which can be recommended for web or client/server applications.

Rational Robot: It is an IBM tool used to automate regression,functional and configuration tests for client server,
e-commerce as well as ERP applications.

Selenium: It is an open source web automation tool. It supports all types of web browsers. Despite being open source
it is actively developed and supported.

Framework in Automation
A framework is set of automation guidelines which help in 
1)Maintaining consistency of Testing
2)Improves test structuring
3)Minimum usage of code
4)Less Maintenance of code
5)Improve re-usability
6)Non Technical testers can be involved in code
7)Training period of using the tool can be reduced
8)Involves Data wherever appropriate

There are four types of framework used in software automation testing:
1.Data Driven Automation Framework
2.Keyword Driven Automation Framework
3.Modular Automation Framework
4.Hybrid Automation Framework
